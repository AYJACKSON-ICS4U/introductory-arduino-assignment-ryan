#To-Do List

- We need to confirm that we have successfully eliminated the delay, and are justi working with miliseconds.
- Our next steps are to add the 6 LED's, and impliment the digitalWrite() to switch the voltages from high to low, so that it is an
efficient code for multiple lights.

#Completed

- We have completed the step that gets the button to work, it turns off the light when the button is pressed.
- We got the status of the light to switch from the Default. So, the light starts off, and is only turned on when the light is pressed.
- We have experimented with different changes in the code in order to understand how arduino works.
