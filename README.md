Up to this point, we have done a lot of work on this arduino assignment, but also encountered many issues.
From the get-go, we easily set up our board, but had several issues with it since our board was not running as it should with the code that we were uploading. We had initially thought that there were issues with the wiring, since if we held the wires in certain poistions as we pressed the button, it would work normally. However, if we were not holding the wire in that certain position, it would not work when we pressed the button. 

With the help of M. Reynolds, we went through the code that we were uploading had faults in it, and we quickly fixed those and got the button to work properly. Since then, our major focus has been trying to figure out how to get the light to stay off on default, and then turn on when we press and hold the button, as opposed to its current state where it's default is on, and the light turns off when we press the button. This has proved to be more difficult than we had initally thought it would be, due to the fact that the code that we had thought would work proved to be insignificant in changing the results. Nevertheless, we are continuing to try and accomplish this goal, and will hopefully find a way to get it to work.
